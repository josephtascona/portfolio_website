          Dedicated to enhancing software development with an analytical and disciplined approach.
          I am able to work with minimal direction to solve complex problems, resolve conflicts and respond to customer
          requests. I am able to work in large and small teams to help the productivity of the team as a whole and motivate
          the other programmers through my leadership and skills. And lastly through my strong work ethic and desire to
          improve myself and the others around me, the software and the product will improve as well.
